Repartition 500gb sd card
I don't know if this is the right platform for this or not, but here goes...
I have a 500gb sd card for my android.
I keep running into space issues when I try to move files/apps to the sd card... 
... "not enough storage," even though I only have 12 gb on the card & it recognizes that it is a 500 gb card.
I can only assume that it has been partitioned & I am only accessing part of it. How can I either access the rest of the partitions, or repartition it to have a larger area accessible to me?
